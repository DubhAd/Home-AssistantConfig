# Home Assistant configuration

This is my primary [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) Core configuration, This instance is running 2022.3.8 (Python 3.9.7 built [with this guide](https://blog.ceard.tech/2017/12/upgrading-python-virtual-environment.html)) on a VM, using Proxmox on an old laptop (Intel Core i5-3230M), the VM has two cores and 2 GB of RAM allocated. I use a manual Python virtual environment install [following this guide](https://home-assistant.io/docs/installation/raspberry-pi/).

Each directory has a short readme explaining what's in there, and the purpose of each file or group of files.

## Z-Wave

> My Z-Wave stack is no longer in use

My Z-Wave stack used to run on a Raspberry Pi 3, using the old All in One installer (effectively a [manual install like this](https://blog.ceard.tech/2017/12/installing-home-assistant-in-virtual.html), on a 16 GB card, that I'd [upgraded to Python 3.6](https://blog.ceard.tech/2017/12/upgrading-python-virtual-environment.html). I used a [Razberry](https://razberry.z-wave.me/) board for Z-Wave control. The configuration for that instance, before it was turned off, can be [found here](https://github.com/DubhAd/HomeAssistant-ZWave).

To limit the risk brought by SD card corruption (a known risk with Pi3) I stored the Home Assistant database on a USB stick, and use a multi-port USB charger with sufficient power for all ports, but left one unused. The power cables were short, and high quality, to minimise issues with voltage drop. Of course, I also took [many different backups](https://blog.ceard.tech/2017/10/backing-up-home-assistant.html) to reduce the risk of losing anything.

This was one of a number of Pi3s I've got, and they're all in a [Multi-Pi stackable case](https://www.okdo.com/p/multi-pi-stackable-raspberry-pi-case/), to keep the footprint down. They share an HDMI cable to a nearby monitor, and an old USB keyboard I've got kicking around, because having a Pi fail to respond isn't that uncommon.

I stopped using this in September 2022, having expanded my Zigbee mesh. I may well return to Z-Wave in the future, those Sensative Guard strips are still the best design of door/window sensor I've found, but for now... Z-Wave no more.

## The key software

* [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/)
* [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) to provide remote access, in conjunction with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
* [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) for the MQTT broker
* MariaDB for the database

## Floorplan

I use [Floorplan](https://github.com/pkozul/ha-floorplan) for a high level overview
  * ![Screenshot of floorplan](https://i.imgur.com/8oe0uTQ.png)
  * Showing: 
    * No bins are due for collection otherwise they'd have a yellow outline (collected tomorrow) or red outline (collected today)
    * The living room and family room are occupied
    * The front door is open, motion has been detected in the downstairs hall, and two windows upstairs is open
    * The TV is on in the living room
    * The TV in the family room is on
    * All the mobiles are home, as is the tablet, and the car
    * The office is a bit warm (red temperature), and the humidity in the bathroom and master en-suite is a little high (amber)
    * Oh, and the printer isn't a little low on consumables.
  * The floorplan was created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), by importing the image of the house's floorplan from the purchase paperwork, then drawing over it. If you look [at it](www/custom_ui/floorplan/floorplan.svg) you'll see that I built it up in layers, one for the foundation (ground), one for the structure, and one for the sensors. I don't really use those currently, other than to ensure that the right things are on top (sensors).

## Devices

You can find a list of my [current and previous hardware here](hardware.md).

## Z-Wave and Zigbee

I used the original zwave integration on a remote system, using [Remote Home-Assistant](https://github.com/custom-components/remote_homeassistant). I've since stopped using Z-Wave, as explained above.

For Zigbee I use [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) running on another system. I use this instead of ZHA because my experience with Z-Wave taught me the value of separation.

## Lighting

  * [Yeelight](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/yeelight/) integration and led strips. These provide good enough lighting to read by at night, and also to help wake us in the morning.

## Media

  * [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/) speakers and [integration](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/sonos/)
  * [Squeezebox Radio](https://support.logi.com/hc/articles/360024159134) as a smart alarm clock, and [associated integration](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/squeezebox/)
  * [Cast](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/cast) devices - a bunch of [Google Home Minis](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini), a couple of [Google Home Hubs](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_hub), 
  and a [Lenovo Smart Display](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/smart-devices/smart-home/smart-display/p/ZZISZSDSDX1)

## Notifications:

  * [Telegram](https://telegram.org) for my notifications, supported by Hangouts Chat using a command line notifier, and the [REST notifier](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/notify.rest/) for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) (system status notifications)
  * LaMetric for [notifications](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/lametric/) "in person", and it's a clock the rest of the time
  * [TTS](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/tts/) with the Google Home Mini's, Sonos, and Squeezeboxes

## Presence detection:

  * Back to using [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) for [device tracking](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/nmap_tracker/). While I did switch to [Fritz!Box](https://en.avm.de/) [device tracking](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/fritz/) when I upgraded my router, the router ran out of memory
  * [Monitor](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/monitor) on another Pi3, and an Orange Pi Zero LTS with a CSR 4.0 USB dongle. This has completely replaced the use of the built in Bluetooth device tracker, and more than halved the startup time of HA.
    * This works with our mobile phones, tablets, and beacons
  * [GPS Logger](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/gpslogger/) for remote device tracking
    * I used to use [OwnTracks](http://owntracks.org/) for device tracking, using the HTTP interface, but not only did it have an [annoying bug](https://github.com/owntracks/android/issues/508) that caused it to randomly disable reporting, but it had been abandoned by the developer. Version 2.0 of the app solved both of those, but I've seen no reason to go back.

You'll note I use three different device trackers, two for home (nmap, bluetooth) and one for away (GPSLogger). I explain more about [this here](https://blog.ceard.tech/2020/04/presence-detection-one-last-time.html) (you can see the journey I took to get there, [starting here](https://blog.ceard.tech/2018/01/home-assistant-and-basic-presence.html), with an update [here](https://blog.ceard.tech/2018/09/a-while-back-i-covered-how-i-was-doing.html), and [another update](https://blog.ceard.tech/2018/10/presence-detection-update-3.html), and then [a fourth update](https://blog.ceard.tech/2019/03/presence-detection-are-we-nearly-there.html)). Short version - I don't merge the trackers (that's going away anyway), but I do use groups again.  I've experimented with the [Bayesian](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bayesian) sensor, but compared to what I can do with the automations, it's not flexible enough for me.

## Core integrations and APIs

  * [TransportAPI](https://developer.transportapi.com/) for information on the local train service with the [UK transport](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/uk_transport/) integration
  * [DarkSky](https://darksky.net/dev/) for weather data, alongside the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint), along with the [associated](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/darksky/) sensor [integration](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/metoffice/)
  * [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/sign-in/) for watching media, on TV, tablets and mobiles. I don't currently use [the component](https://home-assistant.io/components/media_player.plex/) even if it's configured
  * [Here Travel Time](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/here_travel_time/) integration, replacing my previous use of the [Google Travel Time integration](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/google_travel_time/) (which uses the Google [Distance Matrix](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/)) to provide estimated time to home

## Other things

  * [Getmail](http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/) with [a script](local/bin/parse-email) that acts as the message delivery agent, to parse the recycling collection emails
    * I gave up on the the [IMAP email content](https://home-assistant.io/integrations/imap_email_content/) sensor since it doesn't keep state through restarts (which isn't unique to it, Home Assistant doesn't have a persistence mechanism other than for the `input_*` entities)
  * A HiWatch IPC-T140 dome camera, using the generic camera integration. I use [MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/) for motion detection and [Doods](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/doods/) (in another VM) for object detection.

## Custom integrations

Historically I didn't make much use of custom components/integrations, however that's changed. Here are the ones I use, and why:

* [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) for intalling, updating, and finding new custom integrations. All other custom integrations are installed using this.
* [Adaptive lighting](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting) (replacing [Circadian lighting](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting/)) since the built in [flux integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/flux) isn't as good.
* [Fritzbox tools](https://github.com/mammuth/ha-fritzbox-tools) to allow me to track the status of the Internet connection
* [Home Assistant Remote](https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote) for linking my Z-Wave and primary instances. This is more effective than my ugly MQTT hack.

### Standard integrations

I moved these all [out here](integrations.md) because it's a long list, and not _that_ interesting.

## Other software

* [PiVPN](http://www.pivpn.io/) for remote access to my network
* [Pi Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) for blocking those pesky adverts
* [netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/) so I can keep an eye on the performance
* [rpi-clone](https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone) for bootable backups of the Pis
* [rclone](https://rclone.org/) for offsite backups
* [rsnapshot](https://rsnapshot.org/) runs on another system, and pulls backups 
* [MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/) for motion detection
* [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) to provide remote access, in conjunction with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

## Notes

* These are (automatically) modified versions of my actual configurations
* The goals with Home Assistant have been:
  1. Minimise human actions, and where that isn't possible streamline those human actions
  2. Provide voice control where the automations don't get it right (but try to fix that)
  3. Have a minimal UI to provide manual control (this is currently the Google Home app)

# Future plans

A large amount of this will require a rewire of the lighting circuits, so that all the light switches have a neutral wire.

## Automation thoughts

* Turn on extractor fans when the humidity is more than 5 points above the adjacent room, turning off once they drop to within 5 points
* During darkness, if a bathroom door is opened, turn the bathroom light on at a low level, turning up to medium when the door closes, turning it off when the person leaves
* Turn on the outside front light when the front door opens, the doorbell rings, or somebody is less than 5 minutes away, and coming home
* Other than bedrooms, when the room is in darkness and there's movement turn on the light at a very low level
* During daytime, if the lights are on for *too long* turn them off
* Seasonal use of the digital LED strip
* Flash the relevant section of the LED strip red if the garage door is opening or closing
