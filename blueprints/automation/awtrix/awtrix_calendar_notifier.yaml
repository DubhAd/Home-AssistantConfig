blueprint:
  name: "AWTRIX Calendar Notifier"
  description:
    "This blueprint will print notification when calendar event happens.

    [Google calendar integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google) was used for initial testing. Other calendars might work too.

    Any icons can be used to describe calendar events. Upload them to AWTRIX ICONS folder and make sure your event title is mapped to them in icon map setting of your automation. I've used trash bins of various colours to remind me about need to take appropriate bin to the street :).

    Sounds are also supported. Separate map should be populated to make it work. If no sounds are set, obviously no sound is triggered. Make sure configured sounds are uploaded to AWTRIX MELODIES folder. More details are [here](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix-light/#/sounds)

    Message is shown every 5 minutes in interval from configurable amount of hours before event start time till event start.

    Inspired by awesome work of Jeeftor
